Sprint 0: Fix critical WebUI blockers - checkpoints + training samples

## Changes

### 1. Fixed checkpoint extension bug (BLOCKER #1)
- Changed glob pattern from `*.pth` to `*.pt` in training_api.py
- Training generates .pt files, but WebUI was searching for .pth
- Added direct scan of train/output/checkpoints/ folder
- Result: 3 checkpoints now visible (epoch_1, epoch_2, best_model)

### 2. Added training samples endpoint (BLOCKER #2)
- Created GET /training/samples endpoint in training_api.py
- Returns list of epoch_*_output.wav files from train/output/samples/
- Includes metadata: epoch number, filename, size, timestamp
- Result: 2 audio samples now accessible via API

### 3. Mounted static samples directory
- Added /static/samples mount in main.py
- Points to train/output/samples/ for audio playback
- Enables browser to stream audio files directly
- Result: Audio files accessible at /static/samples/epoch_N_output.wav

### 4. Added WebUI training samples section
- Created Training Samples card in index.html
- Implemented loadTrainingSamples() function in app.js
- Added HTML5 audio players for each sample
- Result: Users can listen to training progress in browser

### 5. Fixed Docker volume mounts
- Added ./train:/app/train mount to docker-compose.yml
- Both audio-voice-service and celery-worker now have access
- Result: Training files accessible inside containers

## Testing

✅ API endpoints validated:
- GET /training/checkpoints → 3 items
- GET /training/samples → 2 items
- GET /static/samples/epoch_2_output.wav → HTTP 200

✅ Frontend components verified:
- HTML: training-samples-list container exists
- JS: loadTrainingSamples() function integrated
- Docker: train/ folder mounted and accessible

## Impact

### Users
- Can now see training checkpoints in WebUI
- Can listen to audio samples generated during training
- Can evaluate voice quality without SSH/terminal access

### Developers
- Established pattern for training monitoring features
- Fixed infrastructure gaps (Docker mounts, static files)
- Resolved file extension inconsistency
